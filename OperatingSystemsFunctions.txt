One of the operating system functions is memory management,
Computer memory is arranged in a hierarchical manner with the fastest records followed first by CPU cache,RAM and then disk storage.
The OS memory manager coordinates the use of these different types of memory by keeping track of which ones are available,
which will be allocated or de-allocated, and how data is transferred between them. This activity, commonly referred to as virtual memory management,
increases the amount of memory available to each process by making disk storage appear like main memory.
